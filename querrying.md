#Querrying a Database


```SELECT``` is the clause you use every time you want to query information from a database.
```WHERE``` is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
```LIKE``` and ```BETWEEN``` are special operators that can be used in a WHERE clause
```AND``` and ```OR``` are special operators that you can use with WHERE to filter the query on two or more conditions.
```ORDER BY``` lets you sort the results of the query in either ascending or descending order.
```LIMIT``` lets you specify the maximum number of rows that the query will return. This is especially important in large tables that have thousands or even millions of rows.
