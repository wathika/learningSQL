## Querrying multiple tables.


```Primary Key``` is a column that serves a unique identifier for row in the table. Values in this column must be unique and cannot be NULL.
```Foreign Key``` is a column that contains the primary key to another table in the database. It is used to identify a particular row in the referenced table.

#Joins are used in SQL to combine data from multiple tables.
```INNER JOIN``` will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.
```LEFT OUTER JOIN``` will return every row in the left table, and if the join condition is not met, NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.
```AS``` is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table in the result set using an alias.
